                <h2>Facts About Icecream</h2>
                <p>Pizza originated in Italy, with its modern form becoming popular in Naples during the 18th century.
                    The classic pizza consists of a dough base, tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings like
                    pepperoni, vegetables, or seafood. Today, it's one of the most beloved foods worldwide, with
                    variations that differ by region, such as the thin-crust pizza in New York and the deep-dish pizza
                    in Chicago. The largest pizza ever made was over 1261 square meters, created in Rome in 2012!</p>

                <p>Pizza's global popularity exploded in the 20th century, especially after World War II, when American
                    soldiers stationed in Italy brought the dish back to the U.S. Over time, pizza chains like Domino's
                    and Pizza Hut revolutionized how it was delivered, further boosting its accessibility. In addition
                    to the classic Margherita, there are countless varieties. For example, in Japan, pizzas can be
                    topped with unique ingredients like squid or teriyaki chicken. In India, you can find pizzas with
                    paneer (Indian cheese) and curry toppings. Interestingly, pizza isn't just about tasteâ€”it's also
                    linked to community and social gatherings. In Italy, there's a tradition of enjoying pizza with
                    family or friends in a leisurely setting. The dough itself has evolved, with gluten-free and
                    cauliflower crust options available to cater to dietary needs. Pizza also holds the title of a food
                    with countless creative twists, from dessert pizzas topped with chocolate and fruits to vegan
                    alternatives for the cheese.</p>
