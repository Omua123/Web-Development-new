                <h2>Facts About Icecream</h2>
                <p>The history of ice cream dates back to ancient times, with early forms of frozen desserts enjoyed by civilizations like the Chinese, Greeks, and Romans. The Chinese are credited with creating a mixture of milk and rice that was packed in snow to freeze, while the Romans had a habit of snow and ice being flavored with honey and fruit. However, it wasn't until the 17th century that ice cream began to resemble the dessert we know today. It became popular in Europe, especially among the French and Italians, who developed techniques to freeze sweetened cream or fruit mixtures. Ice cream made its way to America in the 18th century, and by the 19th century, it was being mass-produced, thanks to the invention of the hand-cranked ice cream maker. Today, ice cream is enjoyed around the world in countless variations, from artisanal small-batch creations to mass-produced varieties.</p>
